SQL Project – Retail Sales Analysis
Author - Bapu Bordekar 

The Retail Sales Analysis project focuses on exploring and analyzing retail transaction data using SQL to derive meaningful business insights. The dataset contains detailed sales records, including attributes such as the sale date, total sales amount, product details, and other relevant business indicators. The goal is to identify sales patterns, evaluate monthly performance, and determine high-performing periods for strategic decision-making.

The analysis begins with date-time processing, where the month and year are extracted from the sale date column. This enables time-based analysis, making it easier to group sales by specific periods. Using the GROUP BY clause, sales data is aggregated to calculate key metrics, such as average monthly sales, total sales by category, or sales trends over time.

To provide deeper insights, the project applies window functions — particularly RANK() with PARTITION BY year — to compare months within the same year. This allows quick identification of best-performing and worst-performing months each year, revealing seasonal trends and peak demand periods.

Filtering is then applied to the ranked results to isolate top-performing periods, which could guide marketing, inventory, and staffing strategies. By integrating data cleaning steps, the analysis ensures that missing values, duplicate records, or inconsistent data formats do not impact the accuracy of results.

This project showcases strong SQL skills across multiple domains:
Data cleaning for reliability
Aggregation for performance measurement
Ranking for comparative analysis
Time-series analysis to detect seasonal and yearly trends
Overall, the Retail Sales Analysis demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged for actionable insights in the retail sector, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve business performance and profitability.
